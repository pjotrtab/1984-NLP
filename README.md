## 1984 vs NLP

### Overview

Welcome to 1984 vs NLP, a Python project that explores the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by analyzing two iconic sources: George Orwell's novel "1984" and Van Halen's album "1984." This project, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, showcases various NLP techniques to gain insights into the textual content, including generating word clouds and performing sentiment analysis using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).

### Features

**Word Cloud Generation**: Visualize the most frequent words in both the novel and the album's lyrics using word clouds.

**NLP summarisation**: Parse and summarize several files into one clean, analysable text using LSA Summarizer.

**Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize NLTK's Sentiment Intensity Analyzer for sentiment analysis, providing a deeper understanding of the emotional tone in the texts.
